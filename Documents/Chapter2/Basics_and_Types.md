# Basics

## I. Basics
#### 1. Indentation
Python is unique among programming languages because it uses whitespace and indentation to determine block structure.
###### C++
```
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i ++)
{                                    |
cout << "Hi!";                       |  In the scope -> do the command within the '{}'
}                                    |      
```
###### Python
```
i = 0;
for (i = 0, i < 5, i++):
  print("Hi!")
^
Indentation, 1 tab or 3 spaces, up to you ^^ I prefer tab.
```
We will get in deeper into that when you learn about function programming.

#### 2. Comments
To structure and explain your code better, maybe for urself in the future or for you teamm, you should use comments
```
# Assign 10 to x
x  = 10
```
Simply add '#' where you want to comment, usually before the code you want to explain.
